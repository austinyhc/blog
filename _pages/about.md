I am Austin; after years plunging into Smartphone Industry and IC Design, I have found data science is crucial in every aspect possible. Thanks to Jeremy Howard, the founder of Fast.ai, he re-enlightens my passion for Machine Learning, especially Deep Learning and Transfer Learning. I have freelanced with different organizations and continuously strive to apply DL to any project, team, or goal. Hope to meet a ton of you in the sphere of AI and to contribute as best as I can to your community.
